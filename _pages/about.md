I am currently a senior year undergraduate student in Hongyi Honor Class at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Wuhan University.

I have been working as an undergraduate research intern at Sigma Group in Wuhan University since 2021, advised by Prof. Zuchao Li, focusing on machine learning topics. I also had the privilege of working with Prof. Joseph Teran at UC Davis, participating in the field of computer graphics. My undergraduate thesis research is under the supervision of Pro. Huoyuan Duan at the School of Mathematics and Statistics of Wuhan University regarding finite element computation.

My aim is to bridge the gap between advanced theory and practical problems, digging deep into machine learning with my math background and applying it to a variety of scenarios, such as computational graphics or data science. I am currently applying for an applied math (or computational math) Ph.D. position starting in 2024 fall.
