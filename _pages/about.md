I am currently an senior year undergraduate student in Hongyi Honor Class, at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Wuhan University.

I have been working as an undergraduate research intern at Sigma Group in Wuhan University since 2021, advised by Prof. Zuchao Li, focuing on the topics of machine learning. I also had the privilege of working with Prof. Joseph Teran at UC Davis, participating in the field of computer graphics. My undergraduate thesis research is under the supervison of Pro. Huoyuan Duan at the School of Mathematics and Statistics of Wuhan University regarding finite element computation.

My aim is to bridge the gap between advanced math theory and pratical problems, digging deep into machine learning and applying it to a variety of scenarios, such as computational graphics or data science. I am currently applying for a applied math (or computational math) Ph.D. position starting in 2024 fall.
